## Installing Sass

1) Go to Sass Github(https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.26.10)>select your device
2) Move the downloaded folder to your project path>unzip
3) Open Your IDE
4) Open the terminal
5) creat Sass folder
6) creat style.scss inside the created folder

## Checking the command with help

check the dart-sass path and write it inside the terminal with --help to see the line.
For exemple, my command will look like this: ./dart-sass/dart-sass/sass --help

## Creat a style.css and a style.css.map file 

you need to add the following line to the terminal: sass/style.scss style.css
of course, don't forget to used the good path for exemple, I have: 
./dart-sass/dart-sass/sass sass/style.scss style.css

This command creat a style.css file and a style.css.map.

## ignore file

Don't forget to creat a git ignore file to ascape style.css.map file on github for exemple.
Here, I keep it for the note purpose
